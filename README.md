> Slime Shooter is 8 bit top-down shooter game. The game's objective is to kill slimes as many as you can. You can use 6 types of weapon: Machine Gun, Flamethrower, Cannon, Matter, Shotgun and Rocket Launcher. In addition, you will receive up to 10 coins when you kill a slime. Use these coins to buy ammunition!

## Getting Started
Run ```Slime Shooter.jar``` to play the game. (It's a bit laggy ;-; please run with Eclipse to avoid lagging.)

## Documentation
View complete how-to-play and implementation details in ```Slime Shooter.pdf``` (Thai language).

## How to play (in brief)
Press ```W A S D``` to control the character. Use mouse to control the gun's direction, then press ```SPACE``` to shoot. Press ```Q``` or use mouse wheel to switch available weapons and press ```E``` to buy ammo of current weapon.

There are two power-ups in this game: <b>Health box</b> (increase your HP by 30 point) and <b>Damage multiplier</b> (increase player's damage to 150% for 5 seconds). Both of them have 10% drop rate every 2.5 second.

As described above, there are 6 weapon types in this game and each type has its own advantage and disadvantage. So use them wisely in order to survive from those dangerous slimes.
